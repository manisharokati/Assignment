SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not Only SQL) are two different types of database management systems, each with their own strengths .
SQL:SQL databases use a tabular structure (rows and columns) to store data. Each row represents a record, and each column represents a field.
 SQL databases follow ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties, ensuring data integrity in transactions.
 SQL databases have a predefined schema, meaning the structure of the data (table, columns, data types) must be defined before inserting data.
1.Applications requiring complex queries and transactions.
2.Situations where data integrity and consistency are critical.
3.Well-defined and stable data structures.

Examples:
MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server.

NoSQL:
NoSQL databases can handle various data models, such as document-oriented, key-value pairs, wide-column stores, and graph databases.
NoSQL databases allow dynamic schema, enabling developers to insert data without a predefined schema.
NoSQL databases are typically scaled horizontally, by adding more servers to the database.
NoSQL databases often prioritize performance and scalability over strong consistency, providing eventual consistency in distributed systems.
1.Applications with rapidly changing or evolving data models.
2.Big data and real-time applications where horizontal scalability is crucial.
3.Situations where flexibility in data storage and retrieval is more important than strict consistency.
Examples:

MongoDB (document-oriented), Cassandra (wide-column store), Redis (key-value store), Neo4j (graph database).
