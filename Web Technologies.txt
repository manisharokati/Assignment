CORS, or Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, is a security feature implemented by web browsers to control how web pages in one domain can request and interact with resources from another domain. It is a security mechanism to prevent unauthorized access to resources on a different origin (domain) than the one that served the web page.

When a web page from one domain makes a request to a resource (like an API) on another domain, the browser enforces the Same-Origin Policy by default, which restricts such requests. CORS is a way to relax this policy selectively, allowing cross-origin requests under certain conditions.

Simple Requests:

For simple HTTP requests (GET, POST, HEAD), the browser adds an "Origin" header to the request, indicating the origin of the requesting page.
The server can respond with appropriate CORS headers, like "Access-Control-Allow-Origin," indicating which origins are allowed to access the resource.
Preflight Requests:

For more complex requests (e.g., with certain headers or methods like DELETE or PUT), the browser may send a preflight request with the HTTP method "OPTIONS" to check if the actual request is safe to send.
The server responds to the preflight request with headers specifying which origins, methods, and headers are permitted.

Handling CORS Issues:
1.Server-Side Configuration:
Ensure that the server is configured to include the necessary CORS headers in its responses. The key header is often ' Access-Control-Allow-Origin', which specifies which origins are allowed.
2.Wildcard (*) Usage:
For development or public APIs, you might use a wildcard (*) for Access-Control-Allow-Origin to allow any origin. However, this should be used cautiously in production due to security considerations.
