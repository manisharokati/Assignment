Maintaining a clean and efficient codebase is crucial for long-term project success and ease of collaboration. Here are three coding best practices that contribute to a clean and efficient codebase:
1.Code Readability:
  a.Use Descriptive Naming:
  Choose meaningful and descriptive names for variables, functions, classes, and other identifiers. A reader should be able to understand the purpose and functionality of a piece of code just by looking at its names.
  b.Comments and Documentation:
  Add comments sparingly for complex parts of the code or to explain the "why" behind a particular implementation choice. Additionally, provide clear documentation for functions, classes, and modules.

2.Modularization and Separation of Concerns:
    a.Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):
    Each function, class, or module should have a single responsibility. This makes the code easier to understand, test, and maintain. If a piece of code does too much, consider breaking it into smaller, more focused components

3. Error Handling and Testing:
    a.Graceful Error Handling:Implement proper error handling to make your code robust. Use try-catch blocks where necessary and provide meaningful error messages. Handle errors gracefully to prevent unexpected crashes.
    b.Continuous Integration (CI):Integrate your codebase with a CI system to automatically run tests whenever changes are pushed to the repository. This ensures that your codebase remains functional and error-free over time.
